I am a conservation and evolutionary biologist, studying how dynamic landscapes influence the diversity of life on Earth. I'm especially in love with plants, mountains, and plants in mountains. I am currently a PhD Candidate working in the [Eaton Lab](https://eaton-lab.org/research/) in the [Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology](https://e3b.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.
